# SAP_HANA_REAL_TIME_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
Twitter API and data load processes in SAP HANA and Analyzing sentiments based on Tweets Fetched

Objective
Get familiar with the Twitter API and data load processes.

Every day, Global Bike Inc. produces thousands of bikes. Currently, the Shop Floor workers have to walk to the working
stations, which are fixed to a certain place, in order to scan their products and to confirm that a new bike was completed.
This is not only a waste of time which costs a lot of money, but also an exhausting part of the workers’ daily routine,
which can make up to several kilometers a day just to confirm their charges. To counteract these vice president (Operations)
engages production planner to do some research about various mobile devices as an alternative to the fixed working stations.
Production planner is really enthusiastic about this idea and being a passionate Twitter user, he decides to do some analysis
on Twitter data first, to get to know the opinions of users about the new iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4. At lunch he tells his
systems & database administrator about his ideas. Database administrator is always up to date on the newest technologies and 
suggests production planner to use GBI’s SAP HANA system for analyzing the data, as there is a brand new functionality for
loading Twitter Data into the database.

Once the Twitter real time Data in Loaded in SAP HANA 
We can Initiate Sentiment Analysis using NLTK Library and Figure the Sentiments Associated with the Tweets
there by Visualizing the Tweets Sentiment For Each Product in SAP Lumira For Further Insights.
